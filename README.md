# JavaInterpreter
For college homework, I had to implement the basic features of a Java Interpreter. 
I had to develop an execution stack and a system table which keeps track of all variables and their values.
IfStatement, AssignStatement and CompareStatement, just to name a few have been coded from scratch,as well all the data types.
.Java heap and thread statements have also been implemented.The coded Interpreter takes a 
chained value of those statements and computes and prints the correct result. (Also prints the steps taken)

This code will execute the statements one by one showing the ExecutionStack and SystemTable(table of variables and their assigned values)
as well as HeapTable(what are the values in the heap) and FileTable(what files are opened)
