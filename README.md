# JavaInterpreter
For college homework, I had to implement the basic features of a Java Interpreter. 
I had to develop an execution stack and a system table which keeps track of all variables and their values.
IfStatement, AssignStatement and CompareStatement, just to name a few have been coded from scratch,as well all the data types.
The coded Interpreter takes a chained value of those statements and computes and prints the correct result. (Also prints the steps taken)
