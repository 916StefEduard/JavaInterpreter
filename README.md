# JavaInterpreter
For college homework, I had to implement the basic features of a Java Interpreter.
I had to develop an execution stack and a system table which keeps track of all variables and their values.
IfStatement,AssignStatement and CompareStatement,just to name a few have been coded from scratch, 
as well all the data types.The coded Interpreter takes a chained value of those statement and 
computes and prints the correct result.(also prints the steps taken)
